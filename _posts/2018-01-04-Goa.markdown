Welcome to our first journey, our indian first destination and our gatekeeper of this amazing and diversified country.

  Our intent is to enlighten you by describing our adventure and stories, in hopes to show you why this is a must visit place when coming to India or why it can be considered one of its best first stops!

  Because we lived the experience and we believe that it would have helped to know some things ahead, we will be giving you some tips along the way.
Goa was indeed an extraordinary adventure, full of funny moments and family memories. Because it had such an huge impact to the beginning of our trip, we thought it deserved a detailed story that we divided in two partes. Here we start the first. Enjoy the moment and smile!

 **1. The Departure**

  Our India journey started right after closing our building door, at 3:30 am of the 7th December, 2017. Our trip was long, with 36 hours between Lisbon, Portugal and Goa, India. We had the first flight from Lisbon to Paris, France and there we waited a full day!

  At 9:30 pm, in Paris, we had our Air India flight to New Delhi, a 8 hour flight, with two snacks and one dinner included, two carry-on bags and one luggage, on economic class. Everything included was 26 250 INR, when bought two months before.

  This was our first time in a long distance flight, and the first time outside of Europe! Each airplane seat had its own tv installed, one pillow, one light blanket and headsets. After one hour, the flight attendants brought us the dinner. We were already waiting for that one! A full day in Paris, between zero and negative degrees, non-stop (we had no time to lose!) sightseeing was exhausting. By the way, totally worth it!

  As you can see, it was a well confectionized dinner, with enough for you to enjoy. Nevertheless, we recommend you to take ahead some snacks for the trip since it’s a long one and it would have been hard to endure hungry so many hours. In alternative, you can always buy inside, but it will cost you more!

  Three hours later, they brought us the first snack and, one hour before landing, we had our last snack. In general, the food was good, good quality taking into account the cheap price it was (120 INR each) exactly what you expect when traveling by airplane. The highlights were, first, the space we had between seats (not like low cost airlines) and the relaxed environment we had the whole trip.

When we landed in New Delhi, we had many airport assistants guiding us to the Visa and Customs desks, where they gave the Visa stamp on our passports.

  If you are planning to visit India in the future, you should know that you need to apply for the E-visa at the official website (www.indianvisaonline.gov.in) and it costs you something like 45€. There, they will ask you to fill a form with your documents information, upload a PDF of your passport and photo and have the traveling tickets already bought.
After one or two days (but it really depends on how busy they are), you will receive an acceptance letter by email, that you must bring with you printed to the Visa and Customs desks at the indian arrival airport.
Additionally, you will need the address and contacts of your accomodation site (Hostel, Hotel, Resort, friends house, and so on). In case you didn’t booked any place yet, just search for the most used hostel and use their information (the authorities only want to be sure you have a plan when arriving to India). On the airplane to India, the flight attendants will give you a form to fill out and that you must hand over to the officer when getting your Visa stamp at the airport.

  After getting our Visa stamp, we had to go pick up our luggage because it had to pass through customs, and then leave it back at the luggage drop desk (just like when you do the counter check in, but without check in). For all the steps, we had airport assistants showing us the way to make sure we didn’t get lost and that was amazing! Being only inside the New Delhi airport made us realize how happy and welcoming indians can be!

  After all this, we went to the waiting room close to our gate to get our next Air India flight, with destination Mumbai, a 2 hours flight with one snack - two packages of salted peanuts and one water (better than nothing!). While waiting, we made a friend, a cheery french girl doing a Yoga retreat for two weeks in Goa.
After arriving, because we already had the indian Visa, the procedure was much easier and we only had to walk from the airplane to the next and last gate to catch the Air India flight to Goa!

  After a long 36 hours trip, changing airplanes three times, from Lisbon, Portugal to Goa, India, arriving to our final destination was just what we needed! Nevertheless, for our first long flight duration, it was a great experience, full of adventures, new food, new friends made on the way and new stories to tell.

  **2. The Surviving**

  In hopes to get well prepared for the culture shock expected when changing from a western culture to a oriental culture, we started reading blogs and magazines, watching documentaries, movies and youtube videos about India months before our trip.

  Even with all the preparations, arriving to Goa was not what we expected. There were really good surprises, like the always smiling locals or their willing to help (even when they had no idea of how to help us and would call all their friends just to find an answer for us!), amazing food or colorful houses, but also less good surprises.
We arrived at Goa a little bit after 6 pm (local time, meaing 5 hours and 30 minutes difference from Portugal).
The Vasco da Gama airport is pretty small, easy to get your luggage and find the way out. Right after getting out of the Vasco da Gama airport your attention is rapidly shifting between the great number of taxi drivers trying their luck with new tourists arriving and the incredible confusion and noise between cars, motorcycles, Auto Rickshaws and people walking on the side of the roads and the crazy traffic control overall (or no control at all, if you compare it to Europe!).

  If you expect to pass the cultural shock completely by preparing yourself ahead, you are mistaken! Good preparation is essential (your adaptation skills increase for sure), yes, but it won’t stop you from feeling and living all the differences between your and the new culture, feeling detached from this new environment (like if you are an UFO or something).

  This is a step every traveler must pass before enjoying it’s new destination, when leaving it’s culture behind so don’t be scared or worried about it! You will make it if you really want to be immersed in the new culture.
You just have to remember to always be open, flexible and that you can’t understand everything you see when arriving (just like locals won’t understand you)!

  _“Once in a while it really hits people that they don’t have to experience the world in the way they have been told to.” – Alan Keightley_

  The above quote really resume what we are trying to explain here. It can be overwhelming if you try to process all the differences of culture, habits and ways of living between you/what you know and the locals/the unknown.
When you are settled there, you will enjoy your new home as you have imagined. You will be able to recognize all its beauty and mystery and all the flaws and challenges will become your personal triumphs in life.

  **Tip nº 1:** Before traveling to India, watch most recommended movies and documentaries, based on true stories (not fiction!).

  Also, check bloggers and vloggers that had the opportunity to go to the same cities you are planning to go. Get informed by official government websites regarding health and food, security, Do’s and Don’ts (you don’t want to disrespect locals at your first encounter!).
Last, check the expected costs of living, how to communicate with locals, how to bargain, ways to get around/transportation systems and, of course, the best places to visit in the area!

  **3.The Beginning**

  Going from the airport to our place was easy because the price was already negotiated and we knew the taxi driver from our family previous experiences. But, if you’re new to the region, you normally don’t have any contacts and so negotiation is key to reach an agreeable price with taxi drivers! And if you feeling their are being stubborn with you and that you can get better prices, just thank the driver and move to the next one. Keep trying!
To survive and not be scammed in India, you need a lot of patience and some calm and strategic thinking.
Our first mistake or something we would like to have known ahead was that in the region where we were staying there were no ATM’s (that worked with our Visa International Cards - https://www.revolut.com). Nevertheless, we were clever to not use the airport ATMs because most of them there incur extra fees!

  **Tip nº 2:** Regarding ATM/cash machines, find one close by in the city and don’t use the ATMs installed in the airports and train stations because those have a unexpected atm fee (+- 200 INR, depending on the ATM bank). The same applies for exchange agencies. In this case, they don’t have a special fee, but they will give you a very bad exchange rate inside airports. Best suggestion is for you to try to find an exchange office around the city!

  **Tip nº 3:** When using taxis, always ask for their number and use the same taxi driver while in the the region. With this strategy, most of the times you gain leverage and confidence that they won’t charge you extra or take you around the city instead of taking you to the right place (be careful with taxi drivers that offer “tours” around the city and in the end give you a huge bill!).

  After half an hour, we arrived at our guesthouse. You must be thinking that we had a expensive and glamourous place. Not quite! The place had quality like an ordinary Hostel in Europe if you ask for a double bed room. Our place was called Villa Malibu, a budget friendly guesthouse, with a beach 10 to 15 minutes walking distance. We had also a little food stand 10 minutes away and we were between 20 and 30 minutes by taxi/bus to Margão (the biggest city close by). Each night, we payed 815 INR/person, breakfast (more like brunch) each day, water, a/c and electricity all included.

  What we didn’t had included in the rooms and we think is important for you to know:
- Toilet paper (yes it’s possible to survive without it. You adapt in time much easier than you are thinking right now, but for the first days you will be happy to have some paper!);
- Shower gel, shampoo and soap/shower gel;
- Hand soap;
- Hair dryer (a must for some people, for other not so important);
- Detergent or “blue and white” soap (if you are Portuguese, you will know what we mean!);
- Washing machine or laundry tank (we had to wash everything in the lavatory, not the most comfortable thing)

  ![11.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/photos/goa2017/11.jpg)

  As you can imagine, at the time, what we really needed was a long shower and some rest. So, in the first day we decided to go to the beach riding rented bikes (that we found 5 minutes from the guesthouse for 75 INR/day (~1 €). It only took us 15 minutes to arrive there and we were amazed by the things we saw along the way. In Goa, they have a special fish snack, that is basically dried on tar roads, with nets to prevent dogs and birds to steal them (not so effective by what we saw).

  After arriving, we saw some people riding bikes across the beach and so we decided to follow along. Goa coast is full of sand beaches, north to south! The southern beachers stretch for a distance of 30km, with restaurants and bars from one side to the other, but also spots with less movement! The beach we were going to was called Benaulim.The water was not as blue as we were used to back in Portugal, but had warm water (for our surprise), full of shells on the floor and calm and relaxing waves.

  In the same day, we decided to try out the coconut water by suggestion of a friend. For 30-50 INR (depending in how well you can negotiate with locals) we got a big fresh coconut, opened in front of you by a nice lady with a special knife. After drinking, she made a hole on top of the coconut and gave us a straw so we could eat the first signs of young coconut meat (soft white inside of green coconuts).

  We recommend this little treat for hotter days, when you need a fast hydrating and refreshing drink!

  For dinner, we went to the Jack’s Corner restaurant (a 10 minutes walk from our place). For locals, it can be considered a medium-expensive choice, but for travelers it’s pretty cheap!
A full dinner, with drinks was 300 INR/person (~4€).
If you have the chance to go there, we suggest you to try out the Paneer Butter Masala, eaten with rice and/or Naan bread. For a newbie in India, it’s a great starter since is not spicy and has a lot of seasonings.

  Remember, if you're in india normaly there's no cutlery when eating! Use your right hand to get the food (never the left because it will cause some strange looks - it’s the hand they use to clean themselves after going to the WC!), always wash your hands before eating of course and most of all be careful with the spicy dishes!
If you’re not used to chilly and indian curry, just ask a dish with no spicy (and still it will come with some spice).

  If you are vegetarian, India is going to be the easiest country, you ever traveled, to find food. Every place always has vegetarian options and a great number of local restaurants and coffee/tea shops don’t have many meat/fish plates in their menus. Plus, non vegetarians have to be extra careful because most of the meat is not properly stored (they just don’t have the means for that!) and even if it’s well cooked, you can still get sick if the source is not an healthy animal (we saw quite a few cows eating garbage on the street!).

 **Tip nº 4:** For both vegetarians and non vegetarians, the best advice we can leave is to always check for places where locals and families with children are eating because that is always a good sign! Try to avoid open fruits and vegetables, salads and non cooked food in general. Always drink bottled water (if possible with a straw) and if you need snacks, opt for some dried fruits (less expensive in India) or deep fried vegetables (yes, not the most healthy treat but they are truly delicious!).

  It’s all for now, we hope you had some fun!
