Donâ€™t feel stressed, you are suffering from a very common travel problem: The Packing Nightmare!!
You have too much stuff to take with you and you just realized your bag is too small. Or you need some tips from experienced travelers in how have they found the best packing strategies to survive this daunting task.
Either way, here we are to give you some advice and tips! From our experience, if not managed properly this is may be the most energy drawing task prior to traveling.

The first step when packing a traveling bag is to choose your main luggage. Are you planning to take a rolling luggage, travel backpack or carry-on/cabin bag? Also, itâ€™s very important to choose a good quality bag for your trip! You donâ€™t want to carry a bag with broken wheels or zips, or that is heavy and uncomfortable to carry with you all time.

 Then, identify your categories. From those, you can separate things and prioritize by level of importance. Letâ€™s begin!

Categories:
Clothes
Medicine
Documents
Hygiene products
Tech Utilities
Non-Tech Utilities
Work materials (laptops, cameras, etc.)

Everything you canâ€™t put in the above categories is not worth your time, meaning that you should get rid of them! This is a perfect moment to examine the things you have been collecting since your last trip or last cleanings! Use this moment as a good opportunity to get rid of clothes you donâ€™t use anymore, electronics, furniture, books, and all the other stuff you donâ€™t even remember when you got it! We suggest you to ask your familiars and friends if they want anything, sell things in a second-hand store, or donate clothes and books to help centers and so on.

Before we move to the second step, you should invest some time to reflect in your trip. How many days/weeks/months are you planning to travel? How is the weather in the destination(s)? How Is the laundry situation there, do you have washing machines or locals normally wash clothes by hand?
If you plan for a long trip, going from 3 weeks to several months like we did, the best thing to do is to choose enough clothes for one week and some extra t-shirts and extra underwear just in case. In this situation, quality over quantity is a must! You donâ€™t want to be heavy while traveling, full of clothes in your backpack!

If you are planning a trip to a tropical, hot and/or humid country, you should take quick drying and loose clothes so you can dry them without complications. Donâ€™t focus too much in pullovers or jackets, just bring a comfortable piece for colder nights! Always bring something to cover your head if itâ€™s a hot country, like a scarf.
Additionally, if you are going to a country where mosquitoes are a common problem, focus in bringing long-sleeved clothes.
Letâ€™s move to the next step! Now itâ€™s time to get into specifics:

Clothes:
Jeans/Pants
Skirts/Dresses
Shorts
Underwear
Long-sleeve shirts
T-shirts
Pajamas/sleepwear

Fitness clothes and shoes

It is very important for you to invest some time in figuring out the best travel apps for your trip. You should consider a language/translation app, a directions app, daylily financial management app and a money conversion app. It would be smart to invest also in airline apps where you can do the online check-in and take your flight ticket in you phone (so you donâ€™t have to worry about printing tickets!).

As a last tip, we suggest that you roll up your clothes to better use of space in your bag!

Not everything listed is mandatory because every trip is an unique experience with unique necessities! You should always adapt and be flexible to each situation. When you travel you get experience that helps you identify the things you REALLY need. Just be sure to give special attention to Medicine and Documents Items, because those leave small space for improvisation while traveling!
We are always updating this lists so if you have suggestions, be sure to let us know by contact link!
We wish you a pleasant trip and hope that your worries are not related to packing anymore! ðŸ˜‰
